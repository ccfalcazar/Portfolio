    <p className='justify lead'>Back when I was in high school one of our subjects is QBasic programming. It really piqued my interest and ever since then, I would like to know more about computer programming and eventually I stumbled upon C++ programming and Visual Basic. I’ve learned several programming tools after Visual Basic but what I mostly focused on Visual Studio C#. I’ve used it to create different windows-based program as its GUI. I’ve also used socket programming with C# as well as creating an Arduino-based project with C# as its user interface.</p>
