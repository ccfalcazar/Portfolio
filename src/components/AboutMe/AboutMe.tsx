    <h3 className='text-center'>About Me</h3>
    <p className='justify lead'>I started programming back in 2001 when I changed school in high school. In my freshman year, QBasic was the first programming language that I have ever used and from there it really piqued my interest in this field. In my sophomore year, I was introduced with HTML and CSS. Although this is not a programming language knowing how to create a website further enhanced my interest with in computer subject which led me to take the Computer Technology field as my technical curriculum in my Junior and Senior year. Turbo C++ was our main programming language during my junior year. We studied and explored many possibilities using this tool to create different dos programs. We also tried integrating C++ with electronics using the parallel port of the motherboard. We created a simple electronic circuit using the preliminary circuit board that is controlled by the C++ program. In my Senior year, we were introduced to Java programming as well as Visual Basic programming. We created a simple calculator using the VB forms as well as a simple notepad application just like what we see in the Windows program.</p>
    <p className='justify lead'>Fast forward to college, I learned many programming languages and learned new techniques to create a program. I started using C# in Visual Studio where I aim to be an application developer. Using C# I learned more about Socket Programming, the 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming and how to integrate different classes on your project. This really enhanced my way to create codes by using Test-Driven Development and Clean Coding. This is also the time I created my first applications that can be used in our businesses to ease some of the repetitive tasks that can be automated using programs.</p>
    <p className='justify lead'>During my intern days, I learned that most of the desktop applications are now being converted into web applications which is much easier to deploy but more tedious to create. I enrolled in a post graduate PHP program in Active Learning to learn more about web development. After studying PHP, I studied javascript in Coursera then I self-studied some of the javascript libraries namely, Reactjs, DataTables, Jquery, Ajax and JSON. I also learned Bootstrap to create a responsive mobile-first web applications and websites. Most of my skillset are for front-end development but I do know how to use mySql and other databases. I can connect to the database and manipulate the data stored in the databases to be used in several applications and pages. I can do all of this with the help of CRUD.</p>
